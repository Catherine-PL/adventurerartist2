*I fell in love from the first look through the plane window*

Madeira is nicknamed The Land Of Eternal Spring, and during my 5-week stay there in January and February 2023, I could experience firsthand how fitting the name is. Although I think that it could simply be called Paradise.

The second half of 2022 was a time of change in my life - after 9 years spent in Kraków, Poland, I packed my stuff, left my job, and went traveling. Finally, I was free! All the hard work over the years paid off, and I was ready for a leap of faith to start another chapter of my life - the life of my dreams, with remote work and winters spent in places with a climate a bit more inviting than Poland’s. With my friends, we chose Madeira for the winter stay of 2023. There, I had one goal: to prepare for tough job interviews.

The time flew by quickly, marked by the weekly change of the rental house. Almost every afternoon, we went for a walk or a hike, also packing weekends with even more hikes!
What I didn’t know about Madeira before arrival was that the north and south of the island are COMPLETELY different experiences during winter months. While I swam in the ocean and enjoyed sunny weather in the south, I was freezing inside the house in the cloudy north. Well, every trip is a learning experience, and my takeaway from this one was that next year I’m bringing an electric blanket with myself for our winter getaway. Just in case!

If you follow my blog or Instagram, you already know that I’m passionate about mountains. And Madeira is full of opportunities for hikers - the byproduct of the irrigation system of Madeira is a net of trails along the levadas, which are artificial canals used to propagate water on the island. Most of our afternoon hikes turned out to be pleasant walks along the well-maintained levadas, with occasional steps up or down leading to a waterfall or two. After multiple hikes, we ended up joking that a walk in Madeira’s cities is a more difficult hike than actual hiking - the levadas were really conveniently set up. For a nature lover, the island is absolute perfection. Due to the humidity and quite early sunsets, I didn’t sketch a lot of trails.

After hiking the most famous trails, we dug deeper into the less popular ones. Some days we walked for 2-3 hours without meeting anyone. And if we met someone? 90% of the time, it was someone from the UK, Germany, or Poland. One memorable day we had to cross several waterfalls, which was fun, but also a bit scary… But, eh, the adventurer is in the name, so I couldn’t chicken out! Another day a little dog joined us on a hike, and we had to pack him into our car, drive 40 minutes around the mountains, and return him back to his home. Poor puppy vomited at the end instead of saying “thank you!”. Yet another time we hiked to the edge of a cliff and for a moment we could see a rainbow that seemed to be there only for us, only for us to see its start and end at the same time!

*It became clear very quickly to me that I won't sketch much on hikes - too humid, too narrow and usually we didn't have much time*

*Swimming in the ocean in January was an otherworldly experience*

We stayed in several places around the island: Funchal (sunny capital), Arco da Calheta (daily problems with the internet at 11 AM indicated that we weren’t the only remote workers in the area), Sao Jorge (woah, it was cold!), Machico (finally some flat ground for running), and Santo Antonio de Serra (otherworldly stay in a XIX-century summer residence of a local family).

Madeira inspired me to create a series of window view sketches. In Funchal, I was amazed by the ferries and giant cruise ships coming and going every day - I could observe all of that from my window. In Sao Jorge, I admired the hilly landscape where the orange rooftops contrasted with nature so perfectly. We didn’t have much of a view in Arco da Calheta and Machico, but in Santo Antonio de Serra, I enjoyed sketching (with) chickens and gooses on the property… when it wasn’t raining. The result is several sketches that are the definitive proof of the switch in my perspective and artistic style. I realized that I’m starting to get even more intense with color, more carefree about proportions but much, much more caring about the impression the moment has left me with.

The end of my stay in Madeira was quite stressful, as I was starting several recruitment processes. My gap half-year was coming to an end, and I actually didn’t mind going back to work. It would just be lovely to avoid all the stressful interviews… Luckily, I ended up being hired in a company that I applied to during the first round of job hunting, yay!

Madeira, the paradise on Earth that I had the privilege of visiting will stay in my heart for a long time. I hope to return some winter and again make a very healthy choice of eating pasteis de nata every day, surf and swim in the ocean, breathe the humid air somewhere in the mountains and be excited about cruise ships coming and going. And, of course, to sketch!
