On August 12-15, 2023, we hosted the second edition of the Urban Sketching Festival in Świdnica, Poland. Tickets sold out within 23 hours of opening registration, with over 150 participants joining us in Świdnica to sketch under the scorching sun.

If you haven’t heard about urban sketching before, I recommend visiting the official website of the Urban Sketchers organization ([link](www.urbansketchers.org)) or our Polish chapter website ([link](www.uskpoland.pl)). In short, urban sketching is about capturing the world around us. Sketchers from around the world connect during meetings: small regular ones or bigger events like our festival or annual symposiums.

The four of us spent over six months pouring our hearts into creating an event that, we hoped, would repeat the success of the first edition. Still, not everything can be prepared ahead, so there was a long list of things to handle during the event. As a second-time festival co-organizer, I knew what to expect: minimum sketching time, maximum organizational issues. How was I supposed to find time to achieve my personal goal of creating a series of reportage-style sketches from the event? The solution was sad for a watercolor lover like me but simple: using quick-drying mediums.

The first two days passed by extremely quickly. Even with the help of our amazing volunteers, there was a lot to do. Workshops, exhibitions, presentations, demos, an art materials fair, sketch-togethers, and drink&draws - the agenda was packed. This year, I especially loved seeing some familiar faces from the first edition returning. That’s the best proof that we created a great experience, and it was so satisfying! There were also some new faces, and some people traveled from far away to sketch with us. I couldn’t help but smile when I saw how friendly and inviting the participants were. I tried to talk a bit with as many people as I could, and of course, sketch something in the meantime.

*Stealing a moment here and there for sketching*


The third day of the festival was when I woke up and said decisively: I’m going to sketch like crazy today! And so I did. Quick sketches with ink here and there - during a workshop by one of our teachers, at our exhibition, in a quiet moment in a church, and even during drink&draw. I found out I actually enjoy working with ink and lines for a change. It’s nice to be able to stand in a shady corner with only a sketchbook and a fountain pen, without the need for a paint case, water cup, and brushes. But of course, the love for watercolor is still strong in me, and when I had more time or a convenient location, I painted.

The last day came in a flash, and soon we started saying goodbyes and officially closing the festival. It was a busy, fun weekend, and I can’t stress how proud I am of everyone who took part in the organization. Also, of the participants who were full of positive energy - without such a great attitude, the event would look different. Thank you!

And after the festival? We sketched. It was a glorious afternoon spent with people who stayed a bit longer, and I finally got to achieve my other personal goal for the event - sketching the famous old pharmacy building.

In the morning after the festival, we had our last breakfast with delicious coffee at what I called 'the headquarters' - a beautiful hotel named 'Barokowy Zakątek,' set in the park close to the UNESCO Heritage Site: Church of Peace. As I did last year, I felt as if I was waking up from a dream. Reality was calling. Final goodbyes, a final sketch, and I was on the long way back home.

I will always be grateful for the opportunity to co-organize an event like this. Before, I never realized how much time and work it takes to create a festival, conference, or other event like that. Now I attend such events with a different perspective. I was able to learn so much, and I keep learning. It’s amazing that I found like-minded people in the co-organizers - the first thing we did after the festival closing was to create a spreadsheet with ideas and issues that can be improved!

The third Urban Sketching Festival in Świdnica will be held from August 15-18, 2024. Want to join? Save the date and look out for the registration opening in June :)
