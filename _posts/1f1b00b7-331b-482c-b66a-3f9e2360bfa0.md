In March 2022, for the first time in my life, I traveled to the United Kingdom. I've traveled extensively before the Covid pandemic and was accustomed to communicating in English, but it was my first time going to a country where people are actual native speakers. What a stress!

*Red bricks everywhere, what a pleasing sight!*

So, London. The city is so big and rich in attractions that I didn't even stress about seeing it all - I decided to take it slow, focus on sketching, and leave some stuff for a next visit. With this mindset, I spent four (shockingly sunny) days there, just walking, walking, and walking some more every day until my feet hurt. I didn't have many expectations when planning the trip; I'd heard that it's a hit-or-miss experience for tourists. For me, it was simply fantastic - and I'm aware that the perfect weather was probably a big factor in that!

*Double-deckers look like they may fall on every turn*

As for the communication with locals, after the initial problems with ordering tea (and that's on me, I should've expected "Do you want milk?"), I realized I know nothing and embraced my inadequacy. All my days in London had the same formula: a morning walk to a museum, then tea and lunch in a park, and after that full focus on just walking and sketching the world around me. I was amazed by central London - the fast pace, people from all over the world walking on the streets, architecture, the red bricks, black taxis, pubs, and coffee shopsâ€¦ Someday, I hope to spend a more extended period of time there. This city has been the backdrop for thousands of books and movies; I'm certain there's a story waiting for me there as well.

*From lunches in the parks... Better than any restaurant!*

Speaking of movies, when I saw the famous blue doors in Notting Hill, it was the only disappointment I encountered throughout my entire trip. I suppose I had imagined them differently!

*Cloudy day*

During my last day, the weather started to get a bit cloudy with occasional showers, but I didn't mind - how beautiful the sky reflected in the skyscrapers! I hope to return soon, to sketch the cityscape again, to lunch in a park, and breathe in the amazing energy of the city.
