*The map of the trip*

Embarking on this journey marked my most ambitious bike trip to date. Packed with stunning views, rain, sunshine, kofola, and laughter, my friend and I fulfilled a long-standing desire to conquer this trail in July 2022, starting and ending in the Polish city of Nowy Targ. I didn't sketch a lot during this trip, but I still carried all the art stuff for hundreds of kilometers, so I want to share this story.

*You sweet summer child, you don't know yet the effort of the next three days ;)*

Day 1 - We set out from Nowy Targ around noon after a train ride from Kraków. Immediately, we found ourselves lost in the forest. Looks like someone was a bit unprepared! Finding our way back cost us nearly an hour(and one wet smelly shoe), the paths wet and muddy. Then came hills and villages in the scorching sun, until we reached the Polish-Slovakian border. After a day of stuffy air it was inevitable -  a heavy storm trapped us under a small roof just meters before the border. Unfortunately, we still had about 500m of elevation to conquer before reaching Zdiar. Sitting under a small wood shelter, thunder and lightning around us and the sun slowly setting down somewhere behind the clouds, we contemplated the most difficult part of the trail still ahead. We finally decided to bike in the rain when it was clear that the storm had passed. Looking back, I recall telling my friend, "I can’t. One more hill and I will just give up", but miraculously, it was only a crazy downhill ride on the empty asphalt road from there. I remember crying from the cold and wind caused by our speed, as well as from the pure thrill and happiness. I’m sure that if there were any cars on the road, we would just pass them by - we didn’t feel the need for brakes.  With tremendous effort, we made it, rewarding ourselves with a delicious Slovakian meal. Full with warm food and happy from warm showers, we crashed into heavy sleep, unaware of how different our situation would be the next evening.

Day 2 - It began with brilliant bike routes offering mountain views. This part of the trail was well-kept and empty. Only us on the hilly paths, under the hot sun again. There was no shade to hide under, and the sun was merciless. After a stop in Poprad for a meal and concert, we biked again. In the fields, I sketched the panorama of the Tatra Mountains. It was strange to see them from the opposite side than just a day before. That day, we biked almost 100 kilometers and had a tired "emergency landing" in the clearing in the middle of the forest. We camped in a wild area, a bit stressful (I couldn't sleep thinking about a bear eating me!).

Day 3 - After a stressful, sleepless night, we packed early and biked through the waking forest surrounded by mist. Not being a morning person, I felt nostalgic seeing such beauty in the morning. Around 8, we already had over 2 hours of biking behind us, so we decided to stop for breakfast in a small city on our way. Still very early, the owner of one of the restaurants took pity on us and opened early. We must’ve looked like a nightmare! The simple taste of eggs, butter, fresh bread, and black tea was heavenly and energizing. I won’t forget the hospitality of those people for a long time. That day was hot again, so we stopped at noon for a swim at a lake and a little nap (after making sure there’s no risk of bears this time, except for the yummy jelly bears). We planned on camping another night but ultimately decided to stay in a nice room in Oravsky Podzamok. It’s a cute city with some nice views, which we discovered during the evening walk. Usually, I have problems falling asleep, but then I fell asleep within an hour.

Day 4 - The last day started well with a beautiful path along the banks of a river. It was quite a different vibe than the days before - wide, open spaces were nowhere to be found. As well as the sun. Sadly, the last 40 kilometers were made in the rain, so we weren’t able to see the Tatra Mountains again. On the bright side, I was able to sketch the beautiful greenery from one of the wooden shelters along the trail. That day I didn’t feel the best physically; I was extremely tired and felt as if I maybe tried to achieve more than I was ready for. But slowly we charged ahead in the constant rain. The satisfaction of seeing the train station in Nowy Targ was huge! I never imagined I'd be able to do something like that!

*Finished!*

This trip was the kind that leaves you exhausted but happy. If I knew how difficult it would be - with the storm on the first day, the sun on the next, and rain again on the last day - I would probably not go. But I did, and now I know where my limit lies: somewhere close to biking 300 kilometers through the mountains in 4 days.
