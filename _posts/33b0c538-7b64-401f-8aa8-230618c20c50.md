*The symbol of the Festival for me. The red door with our poster at the entrance to our hotel, Barokowy Zakątek*

In August 2024, we held the third Urban Sketching Festival in Świdnica. This year, over 200 people joined us and participated in the events that we prepared: art market, lectures, workshops, demos, drink&draws, sketchwalks... As one of the organisers I was really proud of how we were able to make this event, and happy faces everywhere were the proof that we did a good job! 

I didn't have much time to sketch, so I focused on quick reportage in the little Leporello sketchbooks that we received from one of our sponsors - SMTLT - in the goodie bags. Before I share them, I want to thank Świdnica Cultural Centre, all co-organisers, sponsors, volunteers and teachers for the effort they put into this event. THANK YOU! It was a pleasure working with you.

*This year our goodie bags were red. I loved seeing them everywhere during the event, and spotting them on so many sketches!*

A day before the Festival Świdnica was already full of sketchers. Some came from abroad to catch a good night's sleep before the official start, and others were volunteering to pack the goodie bags and set up the Urban Sketchers Poland exhibition.

The second day of the Festival it was rainy, and we joked that it's a perfect weather for an urban sketching event - you have some sun, some rain, everything, to really experience that urban sketching vibe! Painting quickly before the rain comes is a classic experience.

*Once again at Chocoffee, and again...*


At the main square there's a coffee shop called Chocoffee. It's my favourite spot where I grabbed coffee and chocolates daily. It has a variety of different little chocolates, with interesting combinations like chilli and cheese, or toffee and salt...

*Maru Goda's demo*


One of the main locations for the Festival activities is the Church of Peace. It's a giant wooden church with fascinating history. Every year we hold a sketchwalk there. This year, we had a workshop, an Instagram live and a sketchwalk happening there!

The workshops and demos locations were tailored towards the teachers. The teachers presented their skills and different approaches to art out on the streets!

*Urban Sketchers Poland admins. We admired the beautiful sunset before going back to the Photography Gallery, to help amazing volunteers set up the Festival Exhibition before the last day of the Festival*


The night before the last day is a time when volunteers gather to set up the exhibition of artworks created by the participants. It's late and it's a lot of work but it's done quickly. I love moments like this, when a group of people is inspired and working on a common goal so perfectly.

*My sketch after the Festival*


After the Festival, goodbyes and cleaning up in our Hub it was finally time to rest a bit. Everyone did it differently - some went for coffee, others for a quick nap, and others like me - sketching! I didn't sketch much during the Festival so I was eager to do it. After lunch together with remaining sketchers, I went again to the Church of Peace. Our hotel was at the property, but during the Festival there's never enough time to just sit down and relax there. I was sketching solo, grateful for the amazing weather and that everyone left satisfied.

*My night gouache sketches*


I was insatiated. The last evening was a stream of gouache painting sessions. I painted till dark and even later. The night fell and I was still sketching. Someone was practicing the organs and it felt so ethereal to be there at that spot. After sketching for couple of hours without care in the world, I felt like my energy is back. Perfectly timed, because it was time for the last wine and laughs with other sketchers! 

If you want to learn more about the Festival, please check out our www.uskpoland.pl website. And if you're interested in participating in a sketching event in Poland, I have great news for you - in August 2025 we're organising the Urban Sketchers Symposium in Poznań.
