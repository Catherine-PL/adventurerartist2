My first solo trip, focused on sketching, took place in Andalusia, Spain, during the autumn of 2021. The three-week adventure was an unforgettable experience, and here is the itinerary of my journey:

## CÁDIZ:

Originally, I didn’t plan to visit Cádiz; it was a last-minute addition after I missed my first flight… I was supposed to go to Switzerland for 8 days but well, next time! So the beginning of my trip was quite dramatic, but once I set foot in Cádiz, I forgave myself for the missed flight. This beautiful city is a gem, a sketchers’ paradise. Definitely worth a weekend visit!

## SEVILLA:

In Sevilla, I spent about a week trying to visit and sketch as much as possible. The city is so full of beautiful spots that I didn’t manage to cover all I wanted, so I keep it on my list of places to go back to.

I attended an Urban Sketchers meeting there, in the district of Triana. I spent the whole evening talking with locals (OK, trying to follow their fast-paced conversation), and at the end of the meeting, there were two surprises for me: one, the woman I’ve been sketching with for the past hour turned out to have a Polish parent. Two, I sat at the table with a group of 8 sketchers, and only when the time for the group photo came, I discovered that there were dozens of other sketchers on the plaza nearby! Due to the nice weather all year round, the local group can meet every week without worrying about reservations at restaurants to hide from the winter cold.

One of the highlights of my week in Sevilla was a visit to the cathedral. I sketched so much there! And the next morning I met for a coffee and sketch session with Weronika, the sketcher I got to know during the meeting in Triana.

I left Sevilla with a heavy heart; I loved my stay there so much that I thought that the trip couldn't possibly get any better. But I was boarding the bus to the destination of my dreams…

## RONDA:
It was September, and yet it was still hellishly hot. My one-day trip to Ronda, a place I’ve dreamt of for so long, was as amazing as it was tiring. The little city is located on a rocky hill and offers otherworldly views - endless fields and olive orchards below surrounded by distant mountains. Mountains always had a special place in my heart, and the views in Ronda took my breath away. Of course, there was also a compulsory sketch of the famous bridge over the gorge. With no shadow in the middle of the day, it was a difficult but satisfying task.

It was the third place on my Andalusian trip, and the third one I felt like I was leaving too soon.

## GRANADA:
Visiting Alhambra was the main reason I traveled to Spain that autumn. It was added to my travel wish-list a long time ago thanks to… a Korean drama. The drama “Memories of Alhambra” is an interesting mix that you usually don’t see in Korean productions: set partially in Spain with fast-paced action revolving around a video game and with only a sprinkle of romance. But, back to my trip. I loved my (VERY long) visit to the palace, although it was quite packed despite the COVID restrictions. Also, a lot of great spots weren’t really sketcher-friendly, so I mostly sketched on the grounds, not in the interiors.

Apart from the palace, I visited some viewpoints, but the heat started getting to me - the streets felt a little bit too busy and too loud, so I left the city happy but tired, ready to rest.

## CÓRDOBA:
The main tourist attraction of Córdoba is La Mezquita. Inside, hundreds of columns are supporting the roof over the giant interior. I went there with expectations of seeing a place that feels sacred, but was quickly faced with the reality - inside it was simply loud with conversations. I found a quieter corner and made a little sketch despite my disappointment. I spent the next couple of days practicing siestas from morning till afternoon and then roaming the streets during evenings. At this point, over two weeks into my trip, I needed a bit of a holiday from holidays! I left Córdoba rested and ready for my last stop on the continent - the one I already knew quite well.

## MÁLAGA:
My relationship with Málaga could be labeled “Complicated”. It was my third visit there, with the same purpose as two times before - to walk El Camino del Rey, a hiking path close to Málaga. And for the third time, I failed. In the city where it’s sunny almost every day, I managed to be there when there was a storm coming. Yes, three times! And so my hike was canceled every time due to the unsafe weather conditions.

But the city itself is lovely, and the first thing I did after arriving was to take a dip in the ocean while it was still sunny. I admit, I was disappointed. Such bad luck, three times - it felt like destiny. I sketched a bit in the places I remembered from my previous visits, watching as clouds rolled in. The next day I met with my friends for a catch-up and sketch session near the city center. The time passed quickly and just like that, too soon, I was on a flight to Tenerife - but that’s another story.
