It was a cloudy Friday, June 2023. I went for a daily walk with my sketchbook and accidentally found myself in the middle of International Hanseatic Days celebrations in Toruń, Poland.

On one of the old city squares called Rynek Nowomiejski, over two dozen stands were set up and provided information about different cities that once formed the Hanseatic League (a medieval commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and market towns in Central and Northern Europe). I decided it was a perfect opportunity for me to achieve two things: practice sketching quick, busy scenes and learn more about the cities in Germany, Belgium, and more…

I decided to tour the square, stand by stand, stopping here and there for a sketch. It was a fantastic, free opportunity to learn more about art and culture. While I sketched, I talked with people from abroad and Poland about their art experiences - some were visual artists, some dancers or musicians who came to perform on the stage nearby to present their region’s traditional dances and songs - it was a colorful mix of people who just stopped by like me and visitors dressed in regional outfits. After making a round around the square, I returned to my starting spot to sketch artists from Frankfurt an der Oder, with whom I talked at the beginning of my two-hour sketching challenge - they were going to perform some pieces on their instruments. Soon, the crowd started dancing to lively music and I had the perfect last challenge to sketch.

*I usually sketch on a white paper, but this time I wanted to do something different - Hahnemuehle Cappuccino has a light brown paper*

If you live in a city, I recommend attending such festivals and using them as an opportunity to try expressive, quick sketching techniques. I know how difficult it is to draw people, especially when crowds are moving and constantly changing, but there’s no other way to get more confident than just practicing! As you can see in my sketches, I didn’t go into details; just enough of them to show the overall mood of the scene.

*I had the most fun with two or three colored pencils and a fude pen*

Tips for quick sketching of busy scenes in busy places (please ignore whatever doesn’t suit you, it’s just my personal preference, and I ignore some of them sometimes myself):

**-** Prefer one layer over multiple.
**-** On the similar note, do not use a pencil to make a sketch before a sketch (waste of time and freshness of line): if you have to, try to use a pencil only to indicate the general position of composition.
**-** Use quick-drying mediums like pens, colored pencils, fountain pens, or a thin layer of watercolor.
**-** Do not use expensive paper so there’s no pressure to “savor” it with long sketching.
**-** Limit your materials to as much as you can comfortably hold while standing (pockets, fanny bags, or sketchbook holders help). Sketching standing is less comfortable than sitting with a coffee at a restaurant table, but it gives you the freedom to choose your own perfect spot and also motivates to be more decisive while sketching.
**-** Prepare all your materials before you start sketching.
**-** Limit a color palette to waste less time switching between colors.
**-** Only indicate the static elements of composition and focus more on things that are moving and can be gone soon: cars, people, animals, etc. The static elements such as buildings can be finished later since they are unchanging.
**-** Do not focus on one spot too much. Imagine that at any moment the scene may change drastically, so it’s safer to go in a general-to-detail order.
**-** Magic Pencil (a colored pencil with multiple colors at once) is a very useful tool.
**-**  Do not fix lines that are not perfect: if you do, they will call attention more to imperfections and the sketch will lose its freshness.
**-** For people, research a “template”/“recipe” which you can use to set a base to start: find your own method of drawing a figure: think about proportions, order of sketching the body parts etc. This will allow you to quickly set up some figures on the scene and then add details like clothing, hair, accessories. For example, some sketchers use realistic proportions or draw blank faces, and some always draw people as robots… The choice is yours! Your style will change over time or between techniques, so you may end up having different “recipes,” so don’t stress too much about choosing an initial one!
