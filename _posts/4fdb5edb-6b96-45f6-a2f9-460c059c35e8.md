Finally, the secret is out! The 13th Urban Sketchers International Symposium will take place in Poland in 2025! I can't wait to see sketchers from all over the world sketching my country! 

The next host of the Symposium is announced at the closing of the current Symposium. In 2024, the Symposium took place in Buenos Aires. Due to the time difference, the announcement happened in the middle of the night for us in Poland. Admins of Urban Sketchers Poland decided to celebrate this with a weekend together. I'd like to share with you some of my sketches from that October weekend, and some more from Poznań!

Poznań is a gem of a city in Poland, steeped in history since its founding in the 13th century. This city of over half a million people is one of the bigger cities in the country, known for its Gothic and Renaissance-style buildings in the old town. With its iconic landmarks, two castles, modern architecture, and lush green spaces, there’s inspiration around every corner. Poznań is well connected to other European cities with trains and flights. And let’s not forget about the food and warm hospitality of our residents!

The Symposium is an event full of workshops, demos, activities, art market, sketchwalks, drink&draws and infinite opportunities to connect with sketchers from all over the world.

On the sketch above you can see Mr. Periscope - this unofficial symbol of the city appears everywhere in the form of street art, sculpture and more.

Together with other admins of Urban Sketchers Poland, we take part in organisation of the event. There's over a dozen volunteers from all over the world actively working on the Symposium for months before it happens. It's a great opportunity to work with amazing people from different countries and cultures.

If you're interested in coming to Poznań for the Symposium, I hope I can convince you with my sketches from this beautiful city.
