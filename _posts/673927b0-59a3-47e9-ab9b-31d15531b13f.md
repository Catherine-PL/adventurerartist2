  I’m Kasia, but on the web, I usually go by Kate or Catherine. I grew up in the
  northern part of Poland, then moved to Kraków for almost ten years, and now
  I’m (temporarily) back on my old turf - in Toruń. On this blog, I want to
  share my experiences as a hobbyist artist, in a longer text format than
  Instagram allows.

Hello, traveler!

I’m Kasia, but on the web, I usually go by Kate or Catherine. I grew up in the northern part of Poland, then moved to Kraków for almost ten years, and now I’m (temporarily) back on my old turf - in Toruń. On this blog, I want to share my experiences as a hobbyist artist, in a longer text format than Instagram allows. So, if you want fresh updates, please head there (@catherine_pl_art). If you’d like to read a bit more than a few sentences under a photo, you are most welcome!

Art has always been in my life, so when people ask me, “When did you start painting?” I don’t have a clear answer. Since forever, I've held a pencil or a brush in my hand, and during periods of time when I didn’t, I felt anxious. I have always been a practical person with an analytical mind, so my work and education took me on a different path than you would expect from this introduction - I attended high school focused on sciences, went to uni to graduate in applied computer science, and worked at several corporations as a programmer. For a short time during my studies in Kraków, I gave up on painting, only to return to it with even more passion. For a couple of years, I attended evening classes where I practiced figure study and still nature. This gave me the confidence to start creating my own little projects - from series of illustrations to short illustrated stories, and finally to a whole illustrated book that I’m currently working on and planning to self-publish. I’m still developing my artistic voice.

The newest chapter of my artistic journey started in 2019 - I met members of the Urban Sketchers non-profit organization, started attending their meetings in Poland, joined the team of admins of the Polish chapter, and in 2022 was able to co-organize the first Urban Sketching Festival in Świdnica. After the success of the event, we decided to organize the second one, which will be held in Świdnica in August 2023.

As for art mediums, I experimented with cheaper options, usually pencils and watercolor, occasionally soft pastels for figure drawing. Only after joining Urban Sketchers did I start trying new mediums and locations. Suddenly, the whole world became my art studio (not that I ever had one ;)), but watercolor was no longer always the most convenient choice - enter colored pencils, ink, pens, gouache…

What’s next? I hope that the second Urban Sketching Festival in Świdnica will be successful, and that I’ll be able to self-publish my illustrated book about Slavic pagan traditions, "Rooted in Nature," by the end of this year. In September, I’m going to Berlin to meet hundreds of other urban sketchers, which I’m pretty excited about as it will be my first urban sketching event of that scale. After that, I want to focus more on storytelling with art - I already have some ideas in mind!

Thanks for reading!

Kasia
