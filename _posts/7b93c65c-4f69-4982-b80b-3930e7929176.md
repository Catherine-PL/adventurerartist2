No time to waste, let’s dive into my favorite art materials for urban sketching right now!

SKETCHBOOK - HAHNEMÜHLE NOSTALGIE

For me, there’s a clear winner in this category. I’ve tried different sketchbooks, and I usually have two or three of different brands, sizes, and shapes started at the same time, but one of them is always Hahnemühle Nostalgie. With its soft texture, 190g/m2 weight, and hardcover, it's exactly what I need for my sketching style - a layer or two of watercolor mixed with colored pencils or ink details. I’ve been using Hahnemühle Nostalgie sketchbooks for over three years now, and they've never failed me.

Please note that the paper is quite thin and not 100% cotton, so if you like to use a lot of water when painting, it may not be to your liking. But otherwise, it’s a perfect balance of price and quality.

WATERCOLORS - ROMAN SZMAL ART AQUARIUS

I use different brands of watercolors, but currently, my base color set is from a Polish brand: Roman Szmal Art. Aquarius watercolors are great for urban sketching - intense and easily accessible in almost all art supply shops in Poland. I can always quickly restock when I’m out of a single color.

I’m not a person who carries lots of different colors or frequently buys new ones; I prefer to mix my own combinations. But if I ever needed a ready mix, the Aquarius line has over 180 colors available! For two years now, I have stuck to the same set of around 10 colors, and among them, my favorite is Titanium Buff - a brilliant off-white shade useful for many of my urban sketches.

FOUNTAIN PEN - SAILOR FUDE DE MANNEN

Easy choice - Sailor Fude de Mannen. You've probably seen this green fountain pen in the hands of many sketchers, and for a good reason - it’s nicely priced and oh, it’s a fude nib. Such a perfect and versatile tool for quick urban sketches. This fountain pen is with me during every sketching trip.

COLORED PENCILS - FABER CASTELL POLYCHROMOS / CARAN D’ACHE LUMINANCE

This one is tough. I recommend both. If you prefer a bit harder pencils, I think Polychromos are better. If you like something more intense but slightly softer, go with Luminance. There’s also a difference in price, with Caran d’Ache being slightly more expensive. I usually use colored pencils combined with watercolor, and I don’t layer much, so both brands are great for my needs. If you’re a colored pencil pro (unlike me), maybe the decision between them will be easier for you!

Honorable mention - Koh-I-Noor Magic Pencils. Yummy!

FINELINER - ROTRING TIKKY GRAPHIC

I know, I know - you probably have Microns? Buy them no more because there’s a more intense, longer-lasting, and more economical option - Rotring Tikky Graphic pens. One caveat is that they’re harder to find than Microns (at least in Poland where I live), but well worth the search. I like the 0.5 and 0.7 sizes the best. Rotring pens have been with me since the beginning of my urban sketching journey.

BRUSHES - ESCODA RESERVA TRAVEL

Escoda brushes are quite expensive, but they're also a good investment. I've had mine for years now, and the tip still holds up quite well. Brushes are where I prioritize quality over quantity. I like Escoda Reserva brushes because they hold a lot of water. Nothing annoys me more while sketching than not having enough water to cover the desired area with paint quickly. Most of my urban sketches are watercolor sketches, and I use only three brushes, two of which are foldable Escoda Reserva travel brushes. The third one is a dagger brush from Renesans. That’s it.

And this concludes my short list of all-time sketching favorites. I experiment with different mediums and art materials, but this short list describes the ones that have stayed with me for a longer time.

Thanks for reading,
