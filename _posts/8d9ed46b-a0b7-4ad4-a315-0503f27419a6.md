*Hello, Berlin!*

Time for Sketches from THE TRIP to Berlin in September 2023!

During three days, I sketched and enjoyed the company of hundreds of sketchers who came to Berlin with the same objective as me: to attend the 2023 USK-Deutschlandtreffen.

I can’t describe how fun it was to see some friends whom I met during the Urban Sketching Festival in Świdnica, and how much I enjoyed discovering Berlin for the first time. The city is so beautiful and full of great sketch spots that I feel I should come back as soon as possible to sketch some more because three days were not enough!

The weather was amazing, as perfect as late summer can get - just sunny from dusk to dawn, so we could sketch anywhere without worrying about rain… heaven!

DAY 1

The train trip from Toruń to Berlin took some time, but I finally arrived at 11 AM and joined my friends from USk Poland who were, of course, already sketching. No time to waste! We joined the official opening in the afternoon, and the rest was as expected - meeting friends, sketching, and eating.

DAY 2

Since it was my first visit to Berlin, I walked everywhere - it is my favorite method of getting to know a city. After a quick visit to the Old National Gallery to check out the small collection of Impressionists' paintings, I was ready to sketch with friends. The weather was perfect for sessions of nap&sketch outside ;) From the places I visited, Nikolaiviertel was a little district that stole my heart.

*The best part of events like that is meeting some friends from abroad!*

DAY 3

On the way to the official closing and exhibition of artworks created during the event, together with the USk Poland team, we decided to make a little detour to sketch the Deutsches Technikmuseum. The impressive facade caught not only our attention - we saw plenty of sketchers coming and going to sketch the exhibition. Next time, I’m definitely going inside too!

I love moments like this - sitting on the ground near a busy place, with a cup of good coffee in hand, focused but also connected to people around me. For me, that moment was one of the highlights of the trip.

DAY 4 - Quick Solo!

Before catching a train home, I managed to revisit some spots, like Nikolaiviertel... although I wasn’t able to finish the sketch. Well, next time! See you soon, Berlin, you caught my attention :)
