*My first sketch upon arrival*

Spring is coming, and it reminds me of my short trip to Hydra, exactly a year ago.

*Donkeys!*

Hydra is a small Greek island where cars are not allowed - except for city service cars - and where cats are treated like royalty. Donkeys carry luggage from the ferry to houses and hotels, slowly walking the labyrinth of amazingly clean little streets of the small city bearing the same name as the island.


After vibrant and loud Athens, where I spent two weeks prior, Hydra was an unexpected gift of quiet. It was my first visit to Greece, and I couldn't have chosen better with the first island! It's easy to filter out the sounds of cars when living in the city; only when faced with the lack of that noise do I realize how loud my environment usually is.

*A quick colored pencil sketch done just when it started to get windy and cool. What a view!*

So, there are no cars, no bikes, and no buses in Hydra - so, what does one do then? You walk, pet the cats, and sketch! I spent three days walking around the harbor, hiking a nearby hill, and enjoying that silence that I knew I would miss.

*Harbor sketches*

If you're looking for a place where you can escape reality, Hydra is for you. Although that may sound shallow, it feels like a movie set or a place frozen in time - only on the second day of my visit did I realize why I had this feeling: it was not even for the lack of cars, but for the lack of various street signs.

*Lazy peaceful sketching during hiking*

It's been a year since I visited Hydra, and I still clearly remember sitting there on a hill, sketching and thinking, 'I found my peace.'
