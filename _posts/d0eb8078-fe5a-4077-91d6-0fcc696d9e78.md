*Black Inked Heart is here!*


Black Inked Heart premiered February 1st 2025 with bi-weekly updates! The story follows Dora, a quiet IT support worker, whose mundane life changes after she discovers a mysterious fountain pen. As the pen unravels her deepest emotions, Dora navigates office dynamics, personal frustrations, and the weight of her own heart. A story of ordinary lives, extraordinary moments, and the courage to look within. But will she find the strength to embrace what she discovers?

How did this story come to life?

Every year I have one bigger art project that I try to finish within 12 months. In 2023, my goal was to create an illustrated book. In 2024, it was to create a web comic!

The story came to me in a sudden surge of inspiration… during an urban sketching meeting. One of my friends, named Dora (whose name I borrowed for the story, despite no similarities between her and the character) has a grey jumper with three black hearts. Anyone who knows Dora knows that she’s a friendly, helpful and full of positive energy person. During the meeting for some reason we joked about the black hearts on her jumper, and I thought: the hearts are so black that they look like they were made with ink with which we were drawing. I don’t want to spoil the story, but this is how the main character was born: Dora, a not-so-positive woman with a black inked heart. Please check out the story!

One of the first things I did when I started thinking about this web comic was to establish art rules for the whole project from start to finish. If you check out my story you'll see that the colour palette is very limited - greys dominate with yellow here and there. I spent a lot of time thinking about a limited palette that will allow me to present a story without running into issues. I hope I did it well!

To be honest, I didn’t manage to achieve my goal in 2024 and it spilled into 2025. While the progress was initially quick, slowly I started realising how BIG the project actually is. I planned the story to be 16 episodes, which is nothing compared to the usual length of stories published on a popular platform called Webtoon. But then, I’m only one person who is responsible for every aspect of the story - writing, design, publishing, and of course drawing, on top of a full-time job. The first short episode took hours to draw. The second was even slower.  I started getting scared of the huge amount of time I will have to put in, and left the project for several months.

The thing is, I don’t let go easily. I already invested over 30 hours of my time at that point, and in the autumn 2024 I started working on the project again. This time it got progressively smoother - the characters were easier to draw each time and I felt more comfortable with trying different perspectives. I also let go of perfectionism. I needed the story finished. While I’m writing this, I still have almost half of the story to draw. But it’s already published, a new episode is released every second Saturday and I’m so proud of myself for not giving up. Halfway through, I can see finally see the finish line. This is the biggest thing I’ve ever worked on as an artist. Next year, who knows? I’m thinking about something even bigger - a game!
