On October 4th, 2022, I embarked on a plane in Warsaw destined for the place of my dreams - South Korea. I spent five weeks there, traveling solo, with only sketchbooks in my hand luggage as companions. While I ventured alone, I was far from lonely - I had the pleasure of meeting some wonderful people along the way.

Before I dive into the details of my trip, let me preface with this: it was the longest flight of my life, my inaugural visit to a different continent, and the longest solo journey I had undertaken. Purchasing the plane tickets (which cost a small fortune, by the way) back in June wasn't a straightforward task. I hesitated multiple times during the booking process, grappling with fear and uncertainty. But looking back, I'm proud of the courage I summoned. My journey to South Korea turned out to be nothing short of incredible.

SEOUL:

My South Korean adventure began in Seoul, where I landed early in the morning with a clear mission for the day: stay awake as long as possible to ward off the dreaded jet lag. I ventured to Starbucks, visited Namsan Park, and successfully stayed awake until 8 PM.

The subsequent days were filled with leisurely tourist activities, my preferred mode: strolling, enjoying attractions without rushing, and pausing for coffee breaks. I swiftly adapted to the new time zone without issues. An unexpected bonus was having a day without phone distractions as my friends in Europe slept while I explored South Korea. There were delightful surprises, such as the local fondness for iced coffee and the refreshing absence of street vendors trying to sell me things. I mustered my basic Korean skills for conversations and sampled local street food. Overall, I cherished the Seoul I experienced, from its efficient metro system to the convenience store lunches. But there were also unexpected downsides, albeit minor ones - I couldn't download Google Maps for the area or use Google Pay. I got so accustomed to using Google Pay that I nearly forgot my debit card's PIN, so it was quite stressful! Another surprise was the pronounced sweetness of the food.

The weather was utterly splendid, and I sketched with fervor. Given it was October, I anticipated autumn foliage, but I was taken aback by the gradual transition from green to orange as the month progressed.

My primary goal for this journey was to savor slow travel, avoiding the frenetic pace of city-hopping. The first week set the perfect rhythm - plenty of walking, sightseeing, and ample time for coffee, cake, and art.

Hiking was another priority, and I set a personal bar of at least one hike per city. Seoul's proximity to Bukhansan National Park, only an hour away by public transport, made it the perfect starting point. I, the ambitious overachiever, chose to hike the park's most renowned peak - Baegundae. At less than 800 meters tall, I naively assumed it would be an easy hike. This miscalculation stemmed from my familiarity with the mountains in Poland, as I hadn't thoroughly researched the details.

The hike proved arduous and steep, a pattern I encountered with subsequent hikes throughout my trip. Despite the challenge, my hiking experience and appropriate footwear helped me conquer the trail without much difficulty. While the path was less crowded, the summit was bustling with activity. Eager to avoid the crowd, I promptly began my descent, promising myself a return visit in November.

SOKCHO:

Or more precisely, Seoraksan National Park. Did I mention I wanted to hike? Well, in Sokcho, I hardly saw the city at all. I made a beeline for the park and spent three full days immersing myself in hiking. During the weekend, a lengthy procession of cars crawled towards the park's entrance, yet most visitors clustered near the gate, enjoying cafes or exploring temples. The park was clearly a preferred weekend getaway for Koreans.

While I expected vibrant autumn hues during my hikes, I was greeted with the lush colors of late summer. It appeared I was a week or two early for the golden fall foliage.

Three days of hiking were followed by classic Korean barbeque dinners, shared with my hostel roommate as we exchanged solo travel anecdotes.

JEONJU:

For Jeonju, I had the luxury of planning an extended stay, intending to embrace a few days of "holidays from holidays." Fate had other plans as I fell ill, spending most of my time confined to my room. Thus, the days fulfilled their purpose, although the outcome differed - rather than returning to travel with renewed vigor, I was weakened and struggled to walk. Gradually recovering, I seized the opportunity to join the local Urban Sketchers group for an event before departing. Sketching alongside locals was a delightful experience. The Urban Sketchers community is vibrant in South Korea, and I looked forward to meeting more groups.

*From local Urban Sketchers meeting*

As per my policy of at least one hike per city - sickness notwithstanding - I embarked on a hike up a nearby mountain called Moaksan. Weak and breathless, I ascended slowly, cherishing the path less traveled(a choice made upon seeing a school trip on the main trail).  For the next two hours on my way to the top I didn’t meet anyone - such a rare treat in today’s world! The hike gradually transformed from an easy trail to a rocky, untamed path, resembling an animal's trail rather than a human route. The rugged terrain provided the thrill I craved. As I ascended, my surroundings were accompanied by the faint hum of mantra from speakers hidden in the hills - a distant Buddhist temple.

Arriving at a clearing, I beheld a panoramic view of the landscape. Alone with nature, a city or two on the horizon, rolling hills extending to the edges of the earth - I sat there, feeling an overwhelming sense of belonging, feeling the same way I always feel when hiking since that first meeting with mountains 15 years ago. It doesn’t matter if it’s Poland, Italy or South Korea - it’s always the same longing and perfection, as long as I can see everything so small and distant below… There’s a Korean drama that ends with a question “Have you found your peace?” and I thought about it that day, because at that spot at that moment, I had. For a restless and nervous person like me, “to find peace” bears much more weight than “to find happiness”, so I think of that moment frequently to this day.

*Moaksan - on the way*

Finally reaching the Moaksan peak, I sketched as I fantasized about working at the transmitter station stationed there. Ironically, my own academic background made this a possibility, as my master's degree specialized in Telecommunications. Though a whimsical notion, I cherished the thought of witnessing daily sunrises and sunsets from such a spot. On the descent, I slowed my pace, reluctant to let the day conclude. It was a day of profound introspection, a day when I found my peace.

The next stop was the vibrant and bustling city of Busan - I invite you to read about it in Part II([link](https://www.adventurerartist.com/blog/f4ae2ee6-b8f7-4a77-9c57-1a8d8cd7a1b3))!
