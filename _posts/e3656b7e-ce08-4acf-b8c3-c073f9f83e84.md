Stories. Since I was a kid, I loved stories. I could read for hours. I used to borrow a crazy number of books from the school library every year until I went to university. Then, I had less time for reading, but movies and TV series were a good enough alternative with which I could multitask. After years and years of consuming stories imagined and told by others, I finally felt ready to start creating my own a couple of years ago. My first attempt, more serious than a single illustration, was a Christmas booklet I wrote as a present for my friends in 2021 - “About Christmas”.

## THE IDEA ##
The goal of the little book was to share my home’s Christmas Eve traditions with friends from the USA. Since I wanted to base the story on personal experiences, no research was needed, making the task easier. So, I had an idea, now came the more difficult part - fleshing out the details and, of course, actual implementation.

## THE RULES ##
Before diving into details, I decided to set some limits on the whole book. I had limited time to finish my present, so I couldn’t go crazy with the design. The rules were as follows: 
1.Colors are limited to black, white, and gray. 
2.The text is handwritten, with the same font and size on all pages. 
3.No dialogue, just short texts presenting each tradition. 
4.The traditions are presented chronologically, in the order they happen during Christmas Eve. 
5.The size is standard A5.

## THE CONTENT ##
After setting the rules, I decided to list the traditions I wanted to include in my book. I wrote them down and allocated a page for each tradition. Then, I removed or condensed some rules so that I had a small enough number of pages to complete the project on time - 16 pages.

## THE STORYBOARD ## 
I drew a storyboard and created a rough thumbnail for each page. Beneath each thumbnail, I wrote a short text that should be included on the page.

## THE PAGES ## 
Now, all the thinking part was done, and what remained was simply painting. I much prefer the design part because I find it the most important aspect of the creative process, but well, the lengthy process of drawing each page in its final form had to be done too! I used Procreate on my iPad and drew the pages in order, with each two-page illustration in a separate file. During the process, I came up with the idea of including a cat on as many pages as possible without making it very obvious. Only after finishing illustrations for all pages did I add the text.

## PRINTING ## 
This part was quite complicated. I wanted my little book to be bound in the middle and was planning on printing it at home, so I had to split and rearrange the files with illustrations a bit until they were ready for printing. It took me several attempts to set the margins right, and my binding was a single thread going through little holes, but it looked cute enough. All done!

Surprisingly, the part that took quite a bit of my time was the last one - the setup that was most comfortable for drawing two-paged illustrations was not perfect for the way I wanted to print them. Also, I made a mistake while setting the size for each page, and I realized it only after finishing the last one - going back and fixing it after already finishing was a good lesson to be more careful in the future!

I was glad that I set some rules at the beginning because the limits really helped in coming up with the style of the book. Without the restrictions, I would have spent much more time on the design part.

Overall, I’m very satisfied with how the book turned out:
