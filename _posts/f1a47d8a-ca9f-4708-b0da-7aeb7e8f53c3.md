*Map that I created before organizing a road trip through Slovenia* 


A couple of years ago, I started making illustrated maps of places I was going to visit. It’s a great way to create a personal souvenir or make the trip preparation a pleasant task. In this article, I’d like to share with you my process. I use Procreate, but any similar application or even traditional media can be used. Let’s start!


# RESEARCH
The first thing I do is research the area that should be included on the map. If I’m visiting a country or an island, it’s quite easy. It’s more challenging if one wants to create a map of the city. Since I usually make maps of cities that I visit as a tourist, I try to include only the area where tourist attractions are - usually a strict city center. If I don’t know anything about the city, I run a quick web browser search and open several tabs with lists like “10 top attractions of…”, “3 days itinerary in…”. Cross-referencing them gives me a pretty good idea of what area should be included. I use the maps from Google Maps as a template - looking at it I can decide on the format of the illustration.


# FIRST DESIGN
I’ve chosen the area and format of my illustration. In the next step, I take a screenshot of the map and trace over it roughly on a separate layer in Procreate. I don’t care much about being very precise; I just need the illustrated map to be more or less accurate. I sketch where the main roads and rivers are located. Then I proceed to identify where the top attractions and places of interest are and put dots with names on a separate layer over the map. This is the time to dig deeper into research - I read more about the city and find the attractions that may interest me; like less-known parks, monuments, museums, or activities. For example - is there a boat cruise available that I’d like to take? If yes, then I place a dot somewhere on the river and mark it with “boat”. Am I interested in some staple food? I’m sure there’s some space on the map to put a little drawing of it!
If I’m making a map of a place already visited, the job is much easier. In that case, I also add some personal stuff like little scenes of what I experienced.
I usually include the name of the location on my map, so at this stage, I block out some space for the writing.

*Can you guess the country at this stage? I made this map after a trip, to revisit some great memories!* 


# SKETCH
In this stage, I turn the layer with a screenshot of Google Map off. What’s left is a network of roads and dots marking places where I’m going to put little illustrations of buildings, landmarks, etc. Sometimes it happens that there are areas of a map tightly packed with dots, but others are quite empty. If it happens, I rearrange the dots a bit because I don’t need the map to be very accurate - I won’t use it for navigation after all. When the map feels balanced enough, I proceed to the next stage.


# COLOR SCHEME AND STYLE
This is the most fun part of the process for me. I choose a color palette and style that can be used with it. I take into account the feelings and impressions I have about the location - does it seem peaceful and a green place? Or maybe it feels like a busy, colorful bulb of energy? Perhaps going there reminds me of a famous figure or a story? What’s the weather like? If I’m going to visit in autumn, how about using warm colors associated with leaves changing colors? And if it’s winter, how about a black and white illustration with an accent color based on a country’s flag? At this stage, I think about where I want to use which color - I keep in mind that I need a base color, usually also another color for water and streets, and that I need to choose the color scheme for little illustrations of points of interest.
Sometimes when I can’t make decisions easily, I paint rough thumbnails of the map with several color schemes and leave it for some time. After coming back with fresh eyes, it’s usually easy to pick the thumbnail I like the most.
At this stage, I also create a sample illustration of points of interest and roughly sketch the writing. It’s a good time to choose how detailed and realistic I want my little illustrations to be.

# PAINTING THE BASE
With the design and colors decided, I start painting the base of the map. The base of the map is everything except writing and illustrations of points of interest that I’m going to add later - so the network of roads, bodies of water, patterns for parks and buildings. During this stage, remember to limit yourself to colors that were chosen in the previous stage - the base of the map is supposed to be working as a background for illustrations. I usually apply the base color, then the color for water, on top of that the color of streets, and only after that, I add patterns and some variations in colors for different areas.

# ADDING ILLUSTRATIONS OF POINTS OF INTEREST
One by one, I start painting little illustrations in the places that I previously marked with dots. I keep the places on separate layers, so it’s easier to apply any changes later if needed. I look up all the places on the internet to get a good idea of how they look, but I don’t trace them from photos - I look for the characteristics, the proportions, and then paint the places from memory. I keep an eye on the size of illustrations - sometimes I make the more famous places bigger or move the finished illustrations a bit if they feel unbalanced.

# ADDING DETAILS
After all planned spots are painted, I take a final look to identify spaces on the map where something can be added.
If there are empty spaces left, I usually fill them with either little illustrations of random buildings or two spotted in the street view in Google Maps for the location, or I add little details. The details can be trees, animals, little monuments, fountains, cars, illustrations of food, even clouds - it’s a good time to add some fun details too!
If I feel like some places need more texture, I sometimes apply a delicate pattern (lines, dots…) over it.


# WRITING
The last stage is adding the name of the place to the map. Since I already have the space dedicated to it, it’s quite easy to finish the work.

*Details and name added - this one is done!* 

# DONE!
Last look, last chance to fix anything that feels out of place - proportions, tweaking the colors, and… we’re done! During the process, we have two things that we gained - a unique map and knowledge about the area. I call it an absolute win :)
