If you haven't read Part I ([link](https://adventurerartist.com/blog/d1e083c3-f9bf-435f-9a63-0aa52b1b40d6)), I recommend doing so before diving into this continuation. Let's jump right in!

*I'm happy... inside! My focused face isn't very welcoming haha*

BUSAN:

My first order of business in Busan involved a hospital visit. Thankfully, I had insurance, which turned out to be a blessing. Probably due to residual weakness from my recent illness, one of my fingers got infected and necessitated antibiotics. Fortunately, it wasn't my dominant hand, so I could continue sketching without pain or discomfort. The hospital experience was initially daunting, but everyone proved exceptionally accommodating and provided clear instructions, despite the language barrier. Remarkably, I was in and out of the hospital within an hour! I can't complain about the process; it was astonishing to receive such prompt care without a prior appointment.

After tending to my finger and spending quality time at the beach, I was eager for another hike and some sightseeing. The illness had left me weaker, emphasizing the value of my relaxed travel pace. I was fortunate once again - I managed to hike Jangsan, a peak that had recently been opened to the public after the removal of remnants from a former minefield (though I must stress that veering off the official trail is strongly discouraged).

My final adventure in Busan consisted of a classic stroll along the coastline on a perfectly sunny day. Looking back, I would have extended my stay in Busan by a day or two. The city's size caught me by surprise, and I missed out on numerous attractions due to time constraints.

*Urban Sketching Festa 2022 in Gyeongju*

Upon learning about an Urban Sketchers event in Gyeongju coinciding with my stay, I promptly added it to my itinerary. The weather during the festival was a mix of clouds and rain, but for an urban sketcher, this was par for the course - it merely presented an opportunity to sketch quicker! The festival's energy was invigorating, and by the second day, I felt emboldened. I casually joined various groups of sketchers, almost as if I were a regular participant. During this time, I sketched alongside folks from Ulsan (regrettably not on my original itinerary) and unexpectedly encountered them the next day while exploring Bulguksa Temple. I also connected with Elisabeth, a fellow sketcher from the UK, who became yet another amazing person I encountered during the journey.

*Sketching the sketchers. Did they spot me too?*

Those days also highlighted the warm Korean hospitality. A passerby generously bought a box of mandarins upon noticing us sketching his city - a random act of kindness. The Ulsan group kindly invited me to share lunch with them near the temple when they saw me solo. Thanks to them, I had the chance to savor authentic home-cooked Korean cuisine. The price I paid? Enduring good-natured laughter due to my chopstick struggles.

SUWON:

*Urban Sketchers meeting. Thank you for spending the time with me!*

Upon returning to Seoul with nearly two weeks remaining to explore the city at a leisurely pace, I found time for spontaneous day trips. November was unexpectedly warm and ideal for sightseeing. On a sunny day, I headed to Suwon, a nearby and easily accessible city via Seoul's public transportation. I commenced with a meetup with the local Urban Sketchers group, sketching the city walls adorned with silver grass. I was once again struck by the friendliness of the Korean people, even in the absence of a shared language. A local journalist spotted us sketching, leading to two sketches, a coffee break, and gift exchange. The event concluded, and I spent the rest of the day sketching the city from atop the old walls - a few kilometers on foot. Along the way, I encountered a famous location from the popular Korean drama "twenty-five twenty-one" and engaged in a brief conversation (in Korean!) with a lady who observed me sketching. The day ended on a perfect note with a tranquil walk back to the bus stop, where couples were enjoying idyllic picnics by a small pond. The scene was so enchanting that it sparked an idea for a series of illustrations once I returned to Poland. The impromptu trip to Suwon stands among the top 10 experiences of my Korean adventure. Beautiful Suwon, I hope to cross paths with you again!

As the trip's end loomed, my spirits dipped; leaving was not something I looked forward to. I had become accustomed to the stable, clear skies of the Korean autumn, identified my favorite cake at a beloved coffee shop chain, and established a comforting routine. To lift my spirits, I engaged in long walks and more hiking! In November, the leaves finally transformed into intense shades of yellow, orange, and red. I fulfilled my promise to myself and revisited Bukhansan National Park, hiked between Ansan and Inwangsan (two small mountains in the heart of Seoul), and completed a circuit around Namhansanseong - a mountain fortress on the city's outskirts.

*To sketch quietly in the mountains - always a pleasure!*


On the final day, I sketched a location that had been on my mind since day one. Somewhere in the city center, a street lined with trees adorned with colorful sweaters during colder seasons awaited. As I passed by on my first day, it had only been five weeks, but I felt like a changed person - more confident and at ease. The moment was a blend of happiness and sadness: elated that it occurred yet sorrowful that it was ending. With immense satisfaction, I finished my sketch on one of the last pages of my sketchbook - a fitting farewell to Seoul.

*Goodbye, Seoul!*

In this article, one thing stands out: mountains stole the spotlight. While I anticipated some hiking when I came to Korea, I hadn't expected to fall so deeply in love. Surprisingly, upon returning to Poland, it's not the food or architecture I miss the most; it's those quiet hikes beneath the clearest, bluest skies.

Remarkably, there were no bad days during my trip - even rainy days or my hospital visit. I'm truly grateful that I didn't succumb to fear; this trip was indeed a dream come true.
