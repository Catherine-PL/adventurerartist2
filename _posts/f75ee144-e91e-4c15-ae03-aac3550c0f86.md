I traveled in Vietnam for three weeks with my friend during November 2024. During that time we were extremely lucky - it didn't rain once during the whole trip! Blue skies, nice people, great nature and coffee to die for... The trip exceeded my expectations. Breathtaking country to visit!

*Hanoi Train Street*


The trip started in Hanoi. After three different planes, we finally arrived from Warsaw. It was midday when we arrived, and we had one goal: survive till 8PM before going to sleep. Jetlag avoided. During couple of days in Hanoi we walked everywhere, some of us greatly enjoying the thrill of crossing the street (not me). Of course, we had to visit the famous Train Street - a little pedestrian street where a train passes several times a day. The tourists can sip coffee and watch trains passing just a meter away. Only after we left Vietnam I learned that the cafes are technically illegal due how risky it is thanks to misbehaving tourists.

*Pho is a common breakfast meal. I quickly got addicted to it*


After Hanoi we took a night train to something more our pace - mountains! The train was quite luxurious and well worth the money. Once we arrived in Sa Pa and ate some pho, we went hiking. The next few days we spent hiking, hiking, hiking. The amazing weather was encouraging.

*Durian coffee & sketch while hiking near Sa Pa*


During one of our hikes we were able to be the first tasters of a durian coffee prepared by owner of Tiny Coffee Sapa cofee shop - please say hi from me if you ever meet him!

*Cat Cat Village in Sa Pa, my favourite sketch from the trip*


Cat Cat village is a tourist attraction which a lot of Vietnamese people visit to take photos. They dress up in traditional clothes of different tribes, mainly Hmong.

*From a marvelous hike near Sa Pa city*


When in Sapa, for the first time in my life I hiked through jungle. We also passed by a bamboo forest!

*At the Fansipan(3147m), the highest peak of Vietnam*


We wanted to hike Fansipan, unfortunately that was not possible solo. Local authorities only allow hiking with a very expensive guide. We decided to take a cable car to the top, where amazing views awaited. I was a little sad that we didn't hike, but on the other hand, thanks to the cable car we could experience the best weather possible - morning sunshine, before clouds inevitably roll over Fansipan. The whole place feels otherworldly and I'm not sure that it's real. A must-visit place!

*A quick sketch in Lan Ha Bay, done between kayaking and biking on Cat Ba island*


After Sa Pa, we took a train back to the East. There we visited a place that made me dream about visiting Vietnam when I was a young kid. Lan Ha Bay. We took part in an organised day trip so I don't have sketches from that day, but it was worth the money, the day was full of attractions and well organised.

*Sketched during an unplanned but appreciated visit to Cat Ba island*


The original plan was to spend a night on a cruise, but since it was sold out we stayed on Cat Ba island. It's a beautiful place where you can really relax, so I don't regret this sudden change of plans one bit! Next, we hopped on a plain to Hoi An. I felt sick that day, so I didn't do much except for eating the best tom yum soup of my life. With limited time, we only spent a day there before jumping on a train to Da Nang.

*Sketching a train going through the famous Hai Van Pass, towards Da Nang*

Da Nang city was the most filled with foreign tourists city that we visited. At least it felt like it. Vietnamese cuisine was almost dominated by pizza, sushi and burgers offered everywhere around. The beach in Da Nang is the most beautiful beach I've seen in my life. I didn't know that sand can be so soft! I always try to swim in every sea I visit, so I didn't miss this opportunity.

*Angry sketch at Sun World Ba Na Hills near Da Nang*

One of the places to visit I had on my bucket lists was the Sun World Ba Na Hills complex. I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I was influenced by social media. I've seen those amazing pictures of a bridge held by two giant stone hands, and expected it to be as amazing in reality. To my dismay, it was overcrowded, much smaller in reality, and the path with the best view was blocked due to the ongoing construction. The park is situated in the mountains but there's not much to do in the complex despite the high price you have to pay to enter. It's full of restaurants and more restaurants, all located in what I can only call faux French buildings. If you ever visit Da Nang, I recommend skipping this tourist attraction.

*Tea and coffee plantation in Cau Dat, near Da Lat*

After visiting Da Nang we hopped on another plane to Da Lat - the most southern region we visited during our trip.

Da Lat was the place that made me say the most touristy thing ever: "I could live here". Gentle hills, blue sky, green fields. I was enamored. We rented a scooter for a day to visit tea and coffee plantation nearby. Beautiful day that I remember as highlight of the trip. The next day we went on an organised day trip that was amazingly done. It was very busy so I don't have any sketches, but I loved visiting bee keepers, tasting crickets, seeing how silk is done...

*Da Lat. Ah, vietnamese coffee! Once you taste it, it never leaves your dreams*


Don't get me started on vietnamese coffee. One day I will set up a coffee shop and we will sell vietnamese coffee, I swear. Coconut and salt coffee were my favourites.

*Back in busy Hanoi for a moment*

From the whole trip, Hanoi was my least favourite city. The scooters everywhere are fun to watch, but crossing the streets was a bit too stressful for me. I felt much better when we were out in the nature. The last place we visited during the trip was famous Ninh Binh. It's located a short train ride away from Hanoi, so there's a lot of tourists there. Rightly so. In Ninh Binh you can book a boat ride that will lead you through several caves and allow you to visit different temples on the route. You can also hike up the hills of Mua Caves to see the lotus fields beneath. It's a perfect place if you want to spend time in nature without having to travel far away from Hanoi.

*Trang An*

The boat ride in Trang An took around 3 hours. We were lucky to have arrived early so our route was empty and quiet. Only when we were returning we saw how many boats there are! I really recommend arriving early to Trang An, before 11. The peace and quite when you glide through the caves is worth getting up early.

*Ninh Binh, on the last full day in Vietnam*

Last day, last hike, last sketch. Last vietnamese coffee, last tea shopping, last, last, last...

*Ninh Binh, how cool is this sketch spot?*

We went back to Hanoi for our flight, happy but tired. It was intense 3 weeks, full of so many new experiences that I was almost glad I get to sit in the airplane for 12 hours and do nothing. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the trip. All went according to my plan, we had no delays, no rainy days and no major accidents. Even unexpected changes in the plan made the trip better. I had a blast every day, exploring a country that I wanted to visit since I was a kid. And it's a beautiful country, with amazing people, coffee, pho, water spinach (this is the most amazing thing I tasted there!), mountains, sea... So much to see there! Every day I felt so lucky and grateful to be able to make my childhood dream come true. That little kid didn't even believe that she will ever be able to cross the Polish border.

*Travel Log - a japanese album I filled with notes, tickets and little sketches during the trip*

During the trip I didn't have much time for urban sketching, so I decided to try making a different kind of souvenir for myself. In the evenings I filled a sketchbook with notes and little drawings describing each day. You can see the sketchbook on my Youtube channel - [CLICK HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix5zrb1cXvE) to see the sketchbook tour. 


Thank you for reading!
