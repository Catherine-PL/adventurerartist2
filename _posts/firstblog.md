Who are Urban Sketchers? It's a non-profit organization focused on connecting people over a shared passion - sketching the world around us. Joining us is easy - just come to one of our meetings or join one of the many Facebook groups where you can share your urban sketches.

And what is an urban sketch? The best way to explain is to share our manifesto:
1.We draw on location, indoors or out, capturing what we see from direct observation.
2.Our drawings tell the story of our surroundings, the places we live, and where we travel.
3.Our drawings are a record of time and place.
4.We are truthful to the scenes we witness.
5.We use any kind of media and cherish our individual styles.
6.We support each other and draw together.
7.We share our drawings online.
8.We show the world, one drawing at a time.

My story? I joined the organization around July 2019, and since then, urban sketching has been one of my main hobbies. The members are usually hobbyists too, so it’s a great opportunity to meet people whose career paths are drastically different from mine, which is extremely inspiring. I’m always looking for the opportunity to learn, and what’s a better way than to talk with people who have different perspectives?

I travel solo quite often, and meeting members of local Urban Sketchers chapters during my trips is always exciting. I once joined urban sketchers in Sevilla, who taught me about the superiority of vino tinto over sangria. I attended a sketching session on the rooftop of the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk. I accidentally appeared in a Suwon newspaper because I joined local sketchers for the coffee & sketch session, and a journalist spotted us.

In Gyeongju, I took part in Urban Sketching Festa - the event where hundreds of South Korea’s sketchers gathered to enjoy creating art together… In short, being a member of the Urban Sketchers organization is like having friends all over the world.

Since October 2021, I've been a co-admin of the Polish chapter of Urban Sketchers. In my role, I help with daily administrative tasks like maintaining the Facebook group, Instagram profile, and our website. I also had an amazing opportunity to co-organize (with Dora Pindur, Justyna Wojnowska, and Marta Ciućka) the Urban Sketching Festival in Świdnica in 2022 and in 2023.

Thanks to the donations to Urban Sketchers, our team received a grant to organize the Festival in 2022. Being a part of the team creating an event that received great reviews from over 100 attendees - it was one of the best moments of my story as an urban sketcher. During the festival, I met artists from all over Europe, whom I hope to meet again - events like that are organized annually by lots of chapters, so it’s not unlikely to cross paths multiple times in the urban sketchers’ world. This year I’m going to my first big event in Berlin - since I joined right before the COVID pandemic, I didn’t have the opportunity to join the worldwide symposium of Urban Sketchers, so most of the events I attended are relatively small.

What does an urban sketching meeting look like? Usually, there’s no need to register in advance; you just need to find a chapter for the area you’re interested in (the best way is to go to Urban Sketchers website or search for a Facebook group) and either join people for the already announced event with your own art materials or ask if anyone wants to meet at a specific date and place. The bigger events - like festivals and symposiums - usually require registration and/or a fee for attending workshops, for example. But you can always join a sketchwalk or meeting for free. The meetings usually start at a relaxed pace with people engaging in small talk at the meeting place, and the time to regroup after sketching is established. Some people join to say hello and then go sketching solo, only to come back after some time to look at others' sketches and take a photo together. The majority of people stay in a group or smaller groups, sketching in the area where the meeting is held - a plaza, sometimes a cafe, or a museum.

*Urban sketching can be practiced not only in urban spaces*

To be honest, a lot of sketchers feel that it’s easier to focus on sketching when solo, and the meetings are best spent with social activities - catching up, sharing good locations, trying others' materials, flipping through their sketchbooks, etc. If you join a meeting, I recommend asking if you can see the sketchbooks of others - it’s a great way to start a conversation with an urban sketcher! Sometimes, after the “official” part of a meeting is concluded with the photo of created artworks, the meeting is continued at another location, with coffee, drinks, or a little snack. You don’t have to stay for the whole meeting and can also join whenever is convenient for you. Some chapters also have stickers or stamps that you can use.
