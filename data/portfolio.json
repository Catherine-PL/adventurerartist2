After years of practicing art, I finally feel confident enough to try telling stories with my creations.

I grew up in Northern Poland but moved to the beautiful city of KrakÃ³w in 2013 to pursue studies in applied computer science. After living there for almost ten years, I finally achieved my dream of fully remote work. I hope to keep traveling during winters and staying in Poland during warmer seasons. I'm currently based in ToruÅ„, Poland.\n\nArt has always been a part of my life, although there was a few-year-long period during my early twenties when it wasn't one of my priorities. After finishing my studies, I once again had more time to create art, and since then, it has been an important element of my weekly routine. These days, I mostly practice urban sketching and I'm an active member of Urban Sketchers organization, but I'm also developing my personal projects - maps from my travels, short stories, and the biggest project so far: my first book, which I hope to self-publish late 2023.\n\nMy other interests include language self-study (currently learning Korean and Spanish), biking, and fulfilling my dreams of traveling the world.","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹  I'm a software engineer, product designer.","description":"I have delivered world-class user experiences to millions of people.
