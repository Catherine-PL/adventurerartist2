I frequently travel solo with sketchbook to observe and present the places I visit, but I also attend and organize urban sketching meetings in Poland, where I live. I co-organised three Urban Sketching Festivals in Świdnica, and currently I'm part of the team organising Urban Sketchers Symposium in Poznań which will take place in August 2025."},{"id":"2","title":"Digital Art","description":"My digital art projects are focused on experimenting.

Recently I discovered my passion for gouache and inks, so I switch my materials pretty frequently.

After years of practicing art, I finally feel confident enough to try telling stories with my creations.

Currently I'm working on my first webcomic \"Black Inked Heart\", available on Webtoon."}],"aboutpara":"Hello, traveler! \n\nI'm Katarzyna Kosiak, an artist who likes to dabble in different mediums and forms of visual arts. I grew up in Northern Poland but moved to the beautiful city of Kraków in 2013 to pursue studies in applied computer science. After living there for almost ten years, I finally achieved my dream of fully remote work. I hope to keep traveling during winters and staying in Poland during warmer seasons. I'm currently based in Toruń, Poland.\n\nArt has always been a part of my life, although there was a few-year-long period during my early twenties when it wasn't one of my priorities. After finishing my studies, I once again had more time to create art, and since then, it has been an important element of my weekly routine. These days, I mostly practice urban sketching and I'm an active member of Urban Sketchers organization, but I'm also developing my personal projects - maps from my travels, short stories, and the biggest project so far: my first book, \"Rooted in Nature\", which is available on Amazon in English and Polish.\n\nMy other interests include language self-study (currently learning Korean and Spanish), biking, and fulfilling my dreams of traveling the world.","resume":{"tagline":"","description":"Here I'm sharing brief notes on my current projects, but you can also check out what I'm up to on my socials:","experiences2":[{"id":"0c2c9d97-04e0-4b61-a3d4-0a91db0672ae","dates":"","type":"webcomic","position":"True story, sister","bullets":"A project with which I want to expand my storytelling skills.
